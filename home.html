<h2>What is Kartisky JS?</h2>
<p>Kartisky JS is non-complete poorly coded (but still better than some StackOverFlow answers to problems) game engine for card HearthStone-like type of games. Game engine is still in making process and has some bugs, we don't recomend using this engine for now, maybe in future it will be usable.</p>
